# Introduction
ProSPyX is an open-source Python software, developed using PyQt5, suitable for fast processing of large X-ray spectral ptychography datasets. The software allows the user to perform constant and phase ramp removal, phase unwrapping, pixel interpolation, and alignment of phase contrast images directly and interactively through multiple buttons. In parallel, it processes the amplitude images of the complex transmittance function of the sample in a back-end manner. Once the post-processing step is complete, the user can perform contrast conversion and then extract both delta and beta spectra to check for the presence of the resonant chemical species within a defined region of interest.
